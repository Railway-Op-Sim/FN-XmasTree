# O, Tannenbaum

This is a simple route consisting of a single loop track. Services are set to spawn at regular intervals. As the focus is on the trains changing the signal aspects/tree lights the timetable will lead to delays, but sit back and relax only worrying about getting the trains around the base back into the tree again.
